The Rail Technical Strategy (RTS) launched in September 2020 and sets a clear direction for the development and uptake of existing and new solutions that are essential for the rail industry to deliver against the challenges it faces.   
  
Since the 2012 version, the RTS has been valuable in aligning thinking and action in the UK and more widely, globally promoting the UK's world-class rail expertise and its vibrant innovation community.  
  
The direction set in the RTS is key to informing the investment pipeline within industry organisations. Senior budget holders in infrastructure managers, vehicle owners, train and freight operators and OEMs have better visibility of the direction of travel when it comes to the technical needs and opportunities that the railway has. This in turn is essential to ensure that supply chain is stimulated to invest with confidence in innovative solutions in the most important areas.  
  
The RTS is also important to guide the prioritization of existing dedicated research and innovation funds that the railway has and facilitate their coordination, including the establishment of easy pathways for progression through the Rail Industry Readiness Levels. It also allows the rail industry to influence and make the best of the R&D spending that exists beyond rail and the transport sector, which could have applicability to the challenges rail faces.
