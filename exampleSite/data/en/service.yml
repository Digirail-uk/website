  content: "One of the long term frustrations around digital transformation in rail
    has been the sectors broad reliance on significant projects and investments to
    drive change.  Industry leaders often find it hard to get excited about a technology
    project unless it is large in scale and worth Â£1M+. At DigiRail, we feel the immediate
    priority for digitization is in and around those systems and process that could
    deliver quick wins, cultural shifts in workforce expectations and short term improvements
    inefficiency.  \n \nDigiRail sees five digital priorities were benefits that can
    be delivered quickly and affordably:\n \n1.\tCustomer Engagement\n2.\tPlanning
    and Resourcing\n3.\tEnabling Colleagues\n4.\tAsset Management\n5.\tHarnessing
    Data\n"
