  description: Powered by DVT
  content: "\nDigiRail sees a future for rail where every colleague embraces digital
    ways of working, where rich data drives most decisions, where industry-wide interactions
    at both commercial and operational level are delivered via digital tools, and
    rail users see the benefit of digitisation in the way that they interact with
    us.\n\nWe call it Digitising the Details, and we are on a mission to help rail
    businesses do just that. Those that do will be perfectly placed to exploit the
    data, efficiency and opportunity that infrastructure level digitisation will bring.\n\nDigiRail
    is proud to be part of DVT. With over 1000 staff in the group and 20 years of
    growth, we have the digital expertise to modernise your business. \n\nDigirail
    is application agnostic, we do not bring one specific product/tool to the market.
    What we do bring is a passion for integrating the best applications into core
    business processes, a focus on helping colleagues begin to adopt those tools and
    applications and we commit to ensure that data is harnessed from these applications
    and exploited in the day to day running of rail businesses."
