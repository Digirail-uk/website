  title: Part of Dynamic Visual Technologies - DVT (industry focus, delivery depth)

    At a system level UK Rail is digitizing. Whether that be the introduction of ERTMS, the opening of new digitally enable control centres or the deployment of modern, connected rolling stock, the big ticket digital change is coming.

    However this change is being brought to an industry that does not benefit from widespread digitisation today or from a culture familiar with digital tools and processes.

    DigiRail intends to help change that. If large scale system digitisation is to be truly successful it needs to land in an environment that can embrace its values and benefits. Workforces need to embrace digital ways of working while retaining the knowledge and understanding of legacy systems that still currently operate much of the infrastructure, data needs to drive most decisions, industry wide interactions at both commercial and operational level need to be delivered via digital tools and rail users need to see the benefit of digitisation in the way that they interact with us.

    We call it Digitising the Details and we are on a mission to help rail businesses do just that. Those that do will be perfectly placed to exploit the data, efficiency and opportunity that system level digitization will bring.
